Ocreeb MK2 is the second iteration of my macropad project. This version features the XIAO RP2040, supports hotswap sockets for the macropad, a detachable switch plate, an OLED screen, and magnetic external modules running the Seesaw firmware.

As I mentioned in the video, there are still major performance issues when using multiple external modules. This is probably due to my implementation of the shared interrupt, and I will look into it. 
Nevertheless, I will supplement this repo with all the files in case you ever wish to use a part of this.
